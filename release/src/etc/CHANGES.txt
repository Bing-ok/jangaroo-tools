Changes since previous releases
===============================

Version 0.1.1
-------------

- Adapted runtime syntax so that older KHTML (Konqueror 3.x) and WebKit
  (Safari/iPhone) engines understand it. Unfortunately, they refuse to
  return the declaration name of a function, neither with Function#name
  nor as part of the result of Function#toString().
  There is a slight decline in similarity between JS2 and compiled code,
  but compatibility seemed more important.
  For example, the compilation output of a JS2 method
    public   function foo(x) { }
  was
   "public", function foo(x) { }
  and now looks like this:
   "public foo", function(x) { }

- In the runtime (Class.js), optimized the super constructor call for
  classes that do not have a super class (only fields are initialized)
  and for classes that do not have field initializers (the super
  constructor, if any, is called directly).
  Since this is a common case (fly-weight pattern: simple classes with
  many instances), there is a measurable speed-up and almost no penalty
  left compared to "manual" JavaScript class construction.
